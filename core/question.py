While thinking of a future profession the tend to decline an opportunity of becoming a doctor after realizing how hard the studying will be. So, I completely agree with this issue and I will strengthen my opinion with appropriate arguments. 
    First of all, I want to emphasize that the length of studying course at a medical university is much longer than at others. In Georgia the difference is approximately 2 years. Secondly, for me it is almost impossible to imagine the difficulty of studying anatomy because it is certain how complicated a human's body is.
    However, some people may think that after becoming a doctor exhausting days spent on studying turn into pleasurable life, but although doctors have high-paid jobs, it is still difficult to face to the responsibility of patients' lives.
    To conclude, it seems obvious to me that becoming a doctor hives one responsibility which only few can have. It makes a doctor's life difficult."""
